# React Project Setup Guide

## 1. Install Node.js (if not already installed)
Download from: https://nodejs.org

Verify installation:
> node -v
> npm -v

---

## 2. Navigate to the React project directory
Example:
> cd path/to/your/project/frontend

---

## 3. Install all required packages
> npm install

This reads package.json and installs all dependencies into node_modules.

---

## 4. Start the React development server
> npm start

The app will open at: http://localhost:3000/

---

## 5. Save the current dependencies (like pip freeze)
> npm install --package-lock-only

OR to explicitly regenerate versions:
> npm list --depth=0 > react-packages.txt

The list of installed versions is stored in:
- package.json
- package-lock.json

Keep both files committed to track project dependencies.

---

## 6. Reinstall on another machine
Just copy the entire folder with `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, then:
> npm install

This will restore all dependencies exactly as in the original setup.

---

## 7. Common Useful Commands

Check installed packages:
> npm list --depth=0

Install a new package:
> npm install package-name

Install and save as dependency:
> npm install package-name --save

Remove a package:
> npm uninstall package-name

---

# Done!
Your React app should now be working.
